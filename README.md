# ALife-Honours
Edinburgh Napier University honours project for Games Development course. </br>
#### Timeframe: September 2023 - April 2024
In this project we are researching how predators/preys can adapt and survive in different environmental change scenarios where they would require to learn fast and in a realistic way IN A VIDEO GAME. </br>
* Software used for creating simulations: NetLogo
* The simulation "STILL IN DEVELOPMENT UTIL APRIL". Everything said in here is not final yet.
* The simulation has two environments:
* 1: Fire/Heat effect. This will burn patches and make food sources inedible. Agents can still walk on burnt patches but will lose energy and eventually die without finding food.
* 2: Flood/Water effect. This will simulate soaked food that becomes inedible, also no agent can walk over water or walk and die.
* The simulation will use NEAT to evolve Neural Networks offline and create agents that can adapt and survive. In addition, rtNEAT will be implemented for real time (online) learning as well.
##### The repository has 4 folders with 4 different simulations that were used for testing against each other
 1. Full simulation with NN and NEAT/rtNEAT, predators/preys and environmental change in effect.
 2. A simulation without any environmental change.
 3. A simulation without any predators.
 4. A simulation with no Neural Network at all.
     
* MORE TO FOLLOW... </br>
GIFS OF SIMULATIONS WILL BE UPLOADED ONCE FINISHED...
