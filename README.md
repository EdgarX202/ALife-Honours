# ALife-Honours
Edinburgh Napier University honours project for Games Development course. </br>
</br>
In this project we are researching how predators/preys can adapt and survive in different environmental change scenarios where they would require to learn fast and in a realistic way IN A VIDEO GAME. </br>
* NetLogo was chosen to build the simulation; therefore, it could be used and adapted to various real world applications and video games.
* This repository is for storing NetLogo simulation files.
* The simulation "STILL IN DEVELOPMENT UTILL APRIL" consist of predator/prey models.
* The 1st model uses offline NEAT and has 1 environment.
* The 2nd model uses rtNEAT for simulating changing behaviour at runtime.
* The environment in the 2nd simulation is split into 2 environments representing different environmental changes. </br>
