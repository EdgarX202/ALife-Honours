# ALife-Honours
Edinburgh Napier University honours project for Games Development course. </br>
#### Timeframe: September 2023 - April 2024 (September to November research and writing) - (December to April development and testing)
In this project we are researching how predators/preys can adapt and survive in different environmental change scenarios where they would require to learn fast and in a realistic way IN A VIDEO GAME. </br>
* Software used for creating simulations: NetLogo
* The simulation "STILL IN DEVELOPMENT UTIL APRIL". Everything said in here is not final yet.
* The simulation has two environments:
* 1: Fire/Heat effect. This will burn patches in the simulation and make food sources inedible. Agents can still walk on burnt patches but will lose energy and eventually die without finding food.
* 2: Flood/Water effect. This will simulate soaked food that becomes inedible, also no agent can walk over water.
* One simulation will use NEAT to evolve Neural Networks offline and create agents that can adapt and survive.
* Another simulation will use rtNEAT to evolve NN in REAL TIME.
* MORE TO FOLLOW... </br>

GIFS OF SIMULATIONS WILL BE UPLOADED ONCE FINISHED...
