#### Timeframe: September 2023 - April 2024
> Research Question: How can evolutionary algorithm be used in creating a more dynamic and adaptive agent behaviour in a video game world where environmental change has impact on life? </br>
* Software used for creating simulations: NetLogo
* The simulation has two environments:
* 1: Fire/Heat effect. This will burn patches and make food sources inedible. Agents can still walk on burnt patches but will lose energy and eventually die without finding food.
* 2: Flood/Water effect. This will simulate soaked food that becomes inedible, also no agent can walk over water or walk and die.
* The main goal is to train and evolve agents over generations; therefore, they should learn to survive and adapt faster to extreme environmental conditions (wildfire/flooding).
###### There are 4 different simulations that are used for testing against each other
 1. Full simulation with NN/GA, predator/prey agents and environmental change in effect.
 2. A simulation without any environmental change.
 3. A simulation without any predators.
 4. A simulation without NN/GA.
     
* MORE TO BE ADDED... </br>
